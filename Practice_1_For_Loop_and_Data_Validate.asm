TITLE Summation1     (Summation1.asm)

; Author: Peter Moldenhauer
; Date: 11/7/16
; Description:  This program gets two integers from the user,
;	and calculates the summation of the integers from the
;	first to the second.  For example, if the user enters
;	1 and 10, the program calculates 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10.

;	Note: This program performs rudimentary data validation.
;	If the user enters a second number that is less than the
;	first number, the numbers will be switched.
